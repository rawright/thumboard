Thumboard v0.2.1

Thumboard is a virtual keyboard intended for use on devices without
physical keyboards and optimized for two-finger (or thumb) input.

This inital version implements a qwerty-type keyboard rather than the
thumboard. The intent is to work out the basics of the virtual keyboard
prior to adding two-finger-enty-optimization logic. This version also
makes use of the top1000 words list and select from that list. Matching
words are displayed following virtual keyboard clicks. The matches
are to word segments from the insertion point back to a previous space
or the beginning of the input area. Fullword matches are redundant so not
shown.

Added Qunit test cases

This version has been tested with Chrome and Firefox. Additional code
is needed to support ie because of the way it implements the selectionStart
and selectionEnd attributes.
