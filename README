Thumboard v0.1

Thumboard is a virtual keyboard intended for use on devices without
physical keyboards and optimized for two-finger (or thumb) input.

This inital version implements a qwerty-type keyboard rather than the
thumboard. The intent is to work out the basics of the virtual keyboard
prior to adding two-finger-enty-optimization logic.

This version has been tested with Chrome and Firefox. Additional code
is needed to support ie because of the way it implements the selectionStart
and selectionEnd attributes.
